/*
 * So we have here an approach which is very progressive, yet delivers results in a short time. It is also quite insensitive to sound events that could derail the heart beat counting, as the first step provide some good indications of the area where is the real heart beat, one spike makes the closer S1 perhaps not detected, but we gain a good idea of the heart duration.
5) In addition to S1, many other events are detected. A priori we assume that these are the other events S2, S3, S4. Even numbers going higher than four, it is useful for unusual heart sound classification.
6) These two Sx events detections are brought closer together
6-1) The list of S1 events is made more reliable, which makes it possible to deduce the events S2, S3, S4 (Segmentation.java).
6-2) A signature of the heart beat is computed to acknowledging there are more in one heart beat than its time of arrival and duration. We tested several schemes, and decided to use a Huffman compression of the heart beat. We had also the idea to use this to yet another kind of feature detection without training but it is not implemented at the moment because of lack of resources.
7) From there one can either train a HMM, or classify. We go out of cardiac specific, itâ€™s just an HMM
8) One interprets the classification made by the HMM, with a score of similarity and comments on the events Sx
